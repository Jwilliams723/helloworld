        <p> I messed this whole thing up lol. It's no longer "hello" but it's "helloworld." I expect to learn how to code and make websites for companies if i get a job. Or I might just make some for fun until i can find a job. I took basic ad design last semester.</p>
        <p> I don't have much experience with this so im a new person learning this. </p>
